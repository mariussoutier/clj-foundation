What is it?
===========
clj-foundation is a replication of Apple's Foundation framework (the Cocoa one, not Core Foundation) in Clojure.

Why?
====
Because there is a lot of cool stuff in Foundation which I'd also like to have in Clojure.

Yeah, but why bother?
=====================
Ok, I'll admit it, it's just to learn both Cocoa and Clojure at the same time.


Enjoy!
